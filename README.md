# DoorKey
ESP8266 solution for door garage remote controllers.

The data was captured and processed with Universal Radio Hacker for the 433.92 MHz frequency used in most garage remote controls.

Things needed:
* A Wemos D1 based ESP8266 controller (could be anything of 8266 family)
* A cheap 433 MHz RF module (GND, VCC, DATA)
